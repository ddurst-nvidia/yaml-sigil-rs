NVIDIA-authored `yaml-sigil-verification` material is licensed under the

## RFC 8032 material

RFC 8032 is an IRTF Stream RFC. Section 8(g) of the IETF Trust Legal
Provisions in effect when RFC 8032 was published states that the provisions
for IETF Code Components do not apply to documents in the IRTF Document
Stream. This crate does not characterize the RFC-derived values as IETF Code
Components or apply the Revised BSD License to them. They are third-party RFC
material used with attribution under the applicable BCP 78 and IETF Trust
framework.

RFC 8032 states that the document is subject to BCP 78 and the IETF Trust's
Legal Provisions Relating to IETF Documents in effect on its publication
date. Section 7(a) of those provisions supplies this warranty disclaimer:

The names of the document authors, the Crypto Forum Research Group, the IRTF,

This crate adapts RFC 8032 sections 5.1, 5.1.2, and 5.1.7 into Rust constants,
point decoding, canonical-encoding checks, challenge computation, cofactored
verification, and fixed provider-qualification vectors. It reproduces one
section 7.1 test-vector public key and signature. Section 3(c) of the IETF
Trust Legal Provisions, version 5.0, addresses reproduction outside the IETF
Standards Process. Section 5(a) states that no patent license is granted, and
sections 7(b) through 7(d) provide the intellectual-property-rights caveat.
The Rust representations and verifier-state mappings are identified
`yaml-sigil-verification` adaptations.
