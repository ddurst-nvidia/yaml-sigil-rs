# yaml-sigil-signing

`yaml-sigil-signing` creates signed YAML and protobuf documents for
[`yaml-sigil`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/yaml-sigil-spec#tldr).

Use this crate to sign payload bytes with Ed25519 or ECDSA P-256 SHA-256 and
emit a `yaml-sigil` artifact. Choose YAML or protobuf output explicitly for
each signing request.

## API Surface

- `sign` is the unified in-process signing entry point.
- `sign_yaml` and `sign_proto` provide form-specific convenience wrappers.
- `sign_with_resource_limits`, `sign_yaml_with_resource_limits`, and
  `sign_proto_with_resource_limits` enforce an explicit complete-output policy.
- `DefaultSigner` and `DefaultAsyncSigner` delegate to the free functions.
- `Signer`, `AsyncSigner`, outcome types, and capability types are re-exported
  from
  [`yaml-sigil-traits`](https://crates.io/crates/yaml-sigil-traits).
- `SigningKey` accepts signing keys from
  [`ed25519-dalek`](https://crates.io/crates/ed25519-dalek) and
  [`p256`](https://crates.io/crates/p256). `SignRequest` uses those same key
  types with the request shape defined by `yaml-sigil-traits`.

The shared traits allow implementations to choose different key types. This
crate's free functions and default signers use the RustCrypto types above.

`SigningKey` debug output is redacted by design. Do not log private keys, seed
material, tokens, or raw signatures on trusted fact surfaces.

## Resource boundaries

The resource-aware signing functions validate the bounded request shape first.
For protobuf output, they calculate the exact prospective wire length from
component lengths before scanning caller buffers or performing cryptography.
For YAML output, they first test a conclusive lower bound that includes any
projected final line feed and the minimum carrier encoding. After signing and
carrier serialization, they check the exact output size before allocating the
complete artifact. Passing the lower-bound check never replaces that final
exact check.

The resource-aware transcoding functions check the original source before
parsing and check the complete destination independently before allocation.
The source and destination lengths are not added together. Errors identify the
form whose boundary failed.

`ArtifactResourceLimits::default()` selects exactly 4,194,304 bytes, and you
can lower, raise, or disable that ceiling. Existing signing and transcoding
functions remain unbounded by this policy. Adoption at the affected trust
boundary, or an equivalent earlier raw-input bound, is required to protect an
existing caller. The policy is operational hardening, not YamlSigil
`v1alpha1` conformance. The 16,384-octet YAML signature-carrier constraint
remains separate.
