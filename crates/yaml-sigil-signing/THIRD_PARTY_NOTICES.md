## RFC 8032 material

The Ed25519 point-encoding, scalar, challenge, and verification rules in
`src/provider_crypto.rs` derive from RFC 8032 sections 5.1, 5.1.2, and 5.1.7.

RFC 8032 is an IRTF Stream RFC. Section 8(g) of the IETF Trust Legal
Provisions in effect when RFC 8032 was published states that the provisions
for IETF Code Components do not apply to documents in the IRTF Document
Stream. This crate does not characterize the RFC-derived material as IETF Code
Components or apply the Revised BSD License to it. It is third-party RFC
material used with attribution under the applicable BCP 78 and IETF Trust
framework.
